							<p>Voice input is probably to TV as to the bread knife to bread. Tv systems are usable without it, but with it they are just
								so much easier. That's no exaggeration. I talk about it briefly in the webpage section, but voice input can be used for a large 
								majority of the stuff that keyboards are used for. Typing with an onscreen keyboard is a terrible experience with a controller or a remote.
								</p>
							<p>Of course the benefits just become even higher when AI is involved. Of course by AI I am talking strictly Voice assitants in this regard. 
								not that there is something inherently wrong with having AI involved in other aspects, it's certainly not within the scope of this. 
								though that's not to say I won't add them if they do crop up. but that's beside the point.
								</p>
							<p>The benefits of Voice assitant are aplenty, from being able to launch games, search videos and do so much more from 
								just the shell, it's easy to understand why google put such an emphasis on their AI. While on phones they are kind of more within 
								the realm of "Hey that's pretty neat.". If you have used the Voice assitant on an android TV, you may know just how valuable they are.
