							<p>Gaming on the bigscreen is probably one of the best usecases for a linux TV enviroment. It wasn't all to long ago
								when Valve tried, and failed to accomplish this with their Steam Machine. This despite what many may think, 
								was not a total faliure. Steam accomplished two things with this project. Unified controller support in games,
								and a large launcher suitable launching games from the comfort of your couch, without needing a keyboard.
								</p>
							<p>Of course this wasnt all great. the UI is a little clunky, and it was was missing a lot of features. it was good for launching 
								games but that was about it. At the time it failed, part to this and part to the fact that linux at the time did not
								have a good library for games. thankfully that has in large part been remedied. with the top thousand games being reported 
								to be of "Gold++" Quality. Meaning, mostly playable.
								</p>
							<p>Mix this with emulation, as to which has come a long way since then. Many Ps3 games are fully playable at 
								4k resolution, and others at 120hz+ refresh rates. Of course it isn't just that, Gamecube, Wii, and many others
								are all emulatable with more than satisfactory preformance. The library of games that linux can play is massive.
								So all should be good right?
								</p>
							<p>Well Not quite. While Steam it'self has a pretty good launcher it doesn't mean that everything does. and while I egarly await 
								the day I can delete this sentence. until then it will be a canary of sorts. once this sentence is gone
								it will be the day I can confidently say gaming on the bigscreen with linux is a "As close to perfect experience as possible"
