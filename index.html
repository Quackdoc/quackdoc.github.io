							<h1>The TV Friendly Linux Databse</h1>
							<p>People spend most of their time infront of screens.
								This is no surprise, Open source sofrware is making strides
								on being part of everyones life. Desktops and smart devices make up 
								over 50% of screen time for the average adult. However linux hasn't made way
								in terms of television, where people can spend anywhere from 20% to 60% of their time.
								 </p>
							<p>The goal of The TV Friendly Linux Databse is to list applications that are not only compatible
								but also a good experience to use on the device where we spend most of our time.

									<h2>The Shell</h2>
									<p>One should not underestimate the importance of the shell. Think of the shell as a map. If the Map 
										is no good, one can not navigate well. as such the importance of the shell to not only be flawless 
										in execution, but also in appearance and feel is high.

							<h2>Applications</h2>
							<p>Applications are the lifeblood of an operating system. Without them, no end user would use the system
								it is important for the needs of such a system to be filled by applications that work without "Jank"
								This means that the applications need to be controlled, to the extent the average user would ever do, 
								fully by means of a device, that fits the want's of a user.
								</p>
							<p>This can best be accomplished by way of remote controll, or a console's controller.
