							<p>The shell is easily the single most important aspect of a TV enviroment. As I said before, the Shell is the map where all the navigation is done. 
								But it's more than that, it is also the first thing you see when you start the device. While there isn't much to say about it. That doesn't 
							mean it's not important. 
								</p>
							<p>A shell should not only be functionally flawless but also good to look at, it should feel fluid, and while being somewhat customizable, 
								the main priority should be fit and finish. Let customization take second place here. Layout and aethetics should be held to a high standard.
								if those haven't been accomplished, don't work on customizability. 
								</p>
							<p>That's not to say you shouldn't keep customizability in your mind. You don't want to have to rework a bunch of stuff in the end, you should 
								still design and code, assuming you will make future changes. but that is the case with any program. thankfully even cheap devices 
								are fairly powerful so you shouldn't need to make all too many concesion in regards to preformance. That doesn't mean bloat things...
								</p>
							<p>There are many design's to choose from too. Sony has their XMB design, which I myself am still fond of. Android Smart TVs have a decent interface 
								as well. LG smart TVs, Apple Smart TVs. Another place of inspiration is consoles. there isn't really much difference between a console and a 
								TV box. Both are designed to be controlled from the couch, both can stream your most popular services. they all can play games to some extent.
								the only difference is app ecosystem. and of course, this is where linux is the best of both worlds.
