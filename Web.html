							<p>Probably both simultaniously the hardest and the least important thing to do. 99% of the people who would use
								a webbrowser on a TV will plug in a wireless keyboard and mouse anyway, but there will always be 
								the one user who will be bummed out over it, he will tell his friends, and before you know it, everyone is calling
								it a crap shoot because it's missing a feature that the vast majority of people couldn't care less about.
								</p>
							<p>as for the difficulty, anyone who has every used baked in web browser on a console or android TV box knows what im talking 
								about, They all suck, using a remote for the modern web sucks. but well, linux has onething that none of these other things 
								have, customizability. and more specifically, STT. On screen keyboards are 90% of the headache gone.
								</p>
							<p> Thankfully this means you don't really need to do all that much. as long as the remote or controller can act as a mouse,
								and STT works in the majority of cases, a simple onscreen keyboard is all you need. at least now development
								only needs to happen to a minority within a minority. of course a standard web browser would work fine if the shell could 
								handle it. but trusting the shell to handle everything is often not a great time, so its best to program a basic pointer in 
								browser. The shell can handle the keyboard. 
								</p>
							<p>Eventually STT and the shell will be able to handle TV usage. but until then the web browser itself needs to handle it.
								Maybe one day I can delete this sentence. and this page in general. but until a shell can handle it, this remains.
