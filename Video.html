							<p>Okay Maybe I exaggerated the necessity of local players a bit. With the world moving away from local storage
								to cloud streaming, many teens probably don't even know that local players exist aside from the ones that 
								download some alone time videos. but teens aside, if you want to enjoy good quality video, Local storage is still the only
								real way to go. As such, a video player is still a necessity.
								</p>
							<p>while it would be nice to just say well map MPV's commands to a controller, (and while in some cases that may work). it's 
								not all that need be done unfortunately. the key features a video player needs to have is a chin bar that has 
								accsess to everything you need, Multimedia controls and settings. 
								</p>
							<p>Of course the settings window, or however the player decides to handle it, needs to be remote controllable too. 
								and should have most of the stuff users are going to fart with. which in my experience is a lot less then one would originally
								think. while it would be nice to have every setting sitting there. I can see why some video players wouldn't bother. 
								Considering the availble programs, this shouldn't be too hard to achieve, but it's kind of stuck until the shell
								can properly passthrough inputs to program, without the program needing to be aware if it's a controller or remote.
