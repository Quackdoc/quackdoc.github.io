							<p>Video streaming is probably the most common form of content consumption in the modern age. and while it would be nice if every website had 
								a good Tv interface like youtube once did, unfortunately they the retired it. as such dedicated programs are usually the go to solution. 
								at the very least, we have programs like Youtube-DL which makes streaming video content, increadibly easy. unfortunately that is 
								about all. as far as interface's go. those will still need to be made.  
								</p>
							<p>The main things that need to be focused on asides from the interface is content discovery. Thumbnails in my opinion are a necessity, 
								Thumbnails are one of the main things used to grab a potential consumers. it is also used to get a general idea as to what the 
								video will entail. aside from that the player needs to be considered too. while rudimentary support by just opening in an external player may 
								be sufficient for testing. however in the long run an app really should have a player for the app.
								</p>
							<p>If the service in question has a TV friendly web interface, treating it as a web app should be suitable for short term. Thankfully 
								with the help of electron, porting your website to a native app is easier than ever before. but in the end, as long as it looks good, works, 
								and feels good, thats the only thing that really matters.
